            <h2>Challenges We Ran Into</h2>
            <p>Despite our efforts to provide a convenient and affordable solution for customers, we faced some challenges in developing our platform. Here are some of the challenges we encountered and how we overcame them:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Challenge 1:</strong> How to reach and register laborers on our site?</li>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To address this challenge, we sent bulk messages to laborers in specific areas or localities, inviting them to register on our platform. We also made it easier for them by providing the option to register at nearby cyber cafes.</p>

              <li><strong>Challenge 2:</strong> How to verify their identity?</li>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To ensure that all registered laborers are genuine, we require them to provide their Aadhar </p>

              <li><strong>Challenge 3:</strong> How to ensure that the laborers are skilled and experienced?</li>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong> To ensure that all registered laborers are genuine, we require them to provide their Aadhar </p>

              <li><strong>Challenge 4:</strong>  AI tool accuracy is low !</li>
              <p><strong>Solution:</strong> We addressed this challenge by inputting thousands of use cases related to construction into our AI chatbot. This helped to improve the accuracy of our AI tool, allowing it to provide more accurate recommendations and advice to customers. </p>

              </ol>
